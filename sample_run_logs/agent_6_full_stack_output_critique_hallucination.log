 PLAN:
 Here's why Agentic AI systems need orchestration logic:

1.  **Coordinate Multiple Agents and Sub-tasks:** Agentic systems often involve multiple specialized agents working towards a larger goal. Orchestration logic ensures these agents operate in the correct sequence, pass information effectively between them, and avoid redundant or conflicting actions.
2.  **Manage Workflows and Dependencies:** Complex tasks require specific ordering and dependencies (e.g., Agent A must complete its task before Agent B can start). Orchestration defines these workflows, triggers agents at the appropriate times, and ensures smooth progression.
3.  **Resolve Conflicts and Handle Ambiguity:** Without orchestration, agents might make independent decisions that conflict, leading to inefficiencies or incorrect outcomes. Orchestration provides a higher-level mechanism to detect and resolve such conflicts, or to prompt for clarification when ambiguity arises.
4.  **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Agents might compete for shared resources (e.g., computational power, access to specific APIs). Orchestration logic can intelligently allocate these resources, prevent bottlenecks, and ensure the most efficient use of available capacity.
5.  **Provide Robust Error Handling and Recovery:** If an agent fails or produces an unexpected output, orchestration can detect the issue, trigger retry mechanisms, notify human operators, or initiate alternative strategies to recover and continue progress towards the goal.
6.  **Maintain Global State and Context:** Individual agents might have a limited view of the overall system state. Orchestration maintains a comprehensive understanding of the current progress, relevant data, and context, allowing it to guide agents more effectively and ensure coherent behavior.
7.  **Facilitate Communication and Data Flow:** Orchestration defines the communication protocols and data formats between agents, ensuring that information is correctly exchanged and understood, preventing "data silos" or misinterpretations.
8.  **Monitor Progress and Provide Observability:** Orchestration logic provides a central point to monitor the activity of all agents, track overall progress towards the goal, and generate logs and metrics for auditing, debugging, and performance analysis.
9.  **Enable Adaptability and Dynamic Re-planning:** As environmental conditions change or initial plans prove ineffective, orchestration can dynamically re-plan tasks, re-route requests, or even bring in new agents to address emerging challenges, ensuring the system remains agile.

Executor: This statement accurately describes a key function of orchestration logic in agentic systems, highlighting its role in ensuring efficient, coordinated, and non-redundant operation among multiple specialized agents.

Executor: It looks like your previous tool request was not parsed correctly. Please ensure it is a valid JSON object when making a tool request. Could you please provide your request again?

Executor: FINAL ANSWER: I'm ready for your next instruction.
Critic: Please provide a prompt for me to evaluate.

Executor: FINAL ANSWER: Thank you for the information regarding managing workflows and dependencies in orchestration. I understand this describes how complex tasks require specific ordering and dependencies between agents.
Critic: PASS

Executor: FINAL ANSWER: I have received the information regarding resolving conflicts and handling ambiguity in multi-agent systems.
Critic: PASS

Executor: This statement describes a key benefit and function of orchestration logic in multi-agent systems, specifically regarding the efficient allocation of shared resources to prevent bottlenecks and optimize usage. It's a conceptual explanation rather than a task or question.

Executor: FINAL ANSWER: I received an error indicating a malformed tool request. Please provide a valid tool request or a new instruction.
Critic: CRITIQUE:
- The user is reporting an error from a previous action and asking for help to fix it (a valid tool request) or move on (a new instruction).
- To provide a valid tool request, the model needs crucial information that is missing:
    - What was the original request or instruction the user gave?
    - What tool was it attempting to call?
    - What arguments does that tool expect?
    - What was the *malformed* tool request that was sent?
- Without this context, the model cannot generate a *valid* tool request.
- The current response *does not* provide a valid tool request.
- The current response *does not* provide a new instruction on how to proceed, other than asking for more information. While asking for information is necessary, the prompt also offered "a new instruction" as an alternative to a valid tool request. A more helpful "new instruction" might guide the user on *how* to provide the necessary information, or suggest a generic way to proceed if they can't recall the exact previous interaction.

A better response would explicitly ask for the missing context to formulate a valid tool request, or offer a path forward if the user can't provide that context (e.g., "Please tell me what you were trying to achieve, and I can help you find the right tool or approach").
