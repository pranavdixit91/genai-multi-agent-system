🎯 GOAL:
 List the top 3 benefits of using vector databases in AI systems

🧠 RELEVANT MEMORIES:
 Vector databases enable efficient similarity search for unstructured data, which is crucial for AI applications like recommendation systems and semantic search.

📝 PLAN:
 1. **Identify the primary function of vector databases in AI:** Based on the memory, it's "efficient similarity search for unstructured data." This will be the first benefit.
2. **Determine what problem this primary function solves for AI:** AI often deals with unstructured data (text, images, etc.). Vector databases convert this into a usable format (vectors) and allow for its efficient retrieval. This addresses the challenge of managing and querying unstructured data effectively.       
3. **Consider the impact of these capabilities on AI applications:** Efficient similarity search and handling unstructured data directly lead to better performance, relevance, and accuracy in AI systems like recommendation engines and semantic search. This will be the third benefit.

➡️ STEP: 1. **Identify the primary function of vector databases in AI:** Based on the memory, it's "efficient similarity search for unstructured data." This wiill be the first benefit.
